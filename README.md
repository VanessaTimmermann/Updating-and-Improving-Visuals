# Updating-Visuals
Improvement of visualisations for data storytelling and clear presentations.

As part of community approaches to refine data storytelling and data visualisation, the original dataset was re-imagined to be more impactful and clear to the stakeholders.

## Storytelling with Data Project
### The original data 
Data was supplied by Storytelling With Data and shows a trend over time for non-profit fundings. 

Support for five sectors is shown as a spaghetti graph with changes recorded over 6 years.

#### Problems: 
- Multiple colours used in comparison with the legend mean eyes have to go back and forth to identify categories
- 2025 values cannot easily be compared to previous years due to the lack of anchoring on the right or gridlines

Whilst gridlines may be in some cases distracting, in this case the lack of a repeated axis or gridlines means that values on the far right can only be compared with difficulty to the previous years.

A main question is the storytelling and imformation needed from this graph.

With some changes, we can categoriese if the funding falls above or below the average of previous years.

Given the limited amount of data&mdash;only one data point per year&mdash;we do not need a time series or line graph at all. We can move to another form to visualise the information and make use of the data points differently.

### Improved Visual

</p>

A single one-slide overview of all key points was produced and a breakdown of insights given on the side. 

#### Improvements:
- A clustered bar chart was used to show the data with minimal further calculations and to identify the categories easier
- A grey block was used to show previous years' funding, as in most cases a specific year's performance will need to be referenced&mdash;the overall trend can still be observed
- The average of the past data was calculated and shown as a box within the graph
- Select data points are colour coded in relation to previous year data with highs in blue and lows as alerts in red
- Highs, lows and current values are given as numbers within the graph for quick reference
- Key findings summarised in the slide itself and use coherent colour coding, so that it can be used as a standalone infographic

The choice of a reduced colour palette means that it is accessible to people with colour vision deficiencies but even clear in full grey scale. Use of a bar/column chart means that the labels are closer to the respective values themselves.

## Reframing the Story

Sometimes, using a traditional method of reporting data does not tell the right story and does not convey the message implied.

### Original data

This example data from Storytelling with Data shows the amount of days four different companies took to reach 1 million users. 

It states that OnceMore.io managed to break the recent record set by ChatGPT, but it does not convey the story adequately.

</p>

When data needs to show that a low value is better, we often need to reframe the story. 

In this case we  show the rate of new subscribers per day. This showcases the extreme magnitude with which OnceMore.io managed to attract users and goes hand in hand with intutive bigger-is-better interpretation of visuals.
