# Updating-Visuals
Improvement of visualisations for data storytelling and clear presentations.

As part of community approaches to refine data storytelling and data visualisation, the original dataset was re-imagined to be more impactful and clear to the stakeholders.

This original data was supplied by Storytelling With Data and whilst showing a trend over time, there is a lack in clarity.

A single one-slide overview of all key points was produced. In most cases a specific year's performance will need to be referenced, so the variation in funding over the previous years was represented by a grey block.

The current values are colour coded and key findings summarised in the slide itself, so that it can be used as a standalone infographic.
